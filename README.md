## Description

### Technologies Used

![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/react-%2320232a.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=%2361DAFB) ![NodeJS](https://img.shields.io/badge/node.js-6DA55F?style=for-the-badge&logo=node.js&logoColor=white) ![WordPress](https://img.shields.io/badge/WordPress-%23117AC9.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=WordPress&logoColor=white) ![GraphQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/-GraphQL-E10098?style=for-the-badge&logo=graphql&logoColor=white)

- **Frontend:** The site is built using the [React JS](https://fr.react.dev/) JavaScript framework. It utilizes reusable components for an optimal user experience.

- **Backend:** The backend was developed with [WPGraphQL](https://www.wpgraphql.com/), a WordPress extension that exposes your [WordPress site as a GraphQL API](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/). It enables flexible and efficient communication between the frontend and backend. This technology is interesting in a **green IT** approach by formulating **only one fetch** API to retrieve all the application data. The API endpoint is `https://api.gaetantremois.fr/graphql`.

- **Email Sending System:** Email sending is managed with Node.js and the [nodemailer](https://www.nodemailer.com/) package. This allows users to contact the developer directly from the site. The email sending API is accessible at `https://sendmail.gaetantremois.fr` and the [repo is here](https://github.com/gtcore902/portfolio-web-dev-backend).

### Features

- **Project Presentation:** The site showcases a selection of the developer's best projects, with detailed descriptions, screenshots, and links to corresponding GitHub repositories.

- **Professional Experience:** A dedicated section highlights the developer's professional experience, including information on positions held, responsibilities, and achievements.

- **Contact Form:** Visitors can use a contact form to send messages to the developer. Messages are sent directly to the developer's email address using the email sending API.
